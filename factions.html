            <p>The Grineer are the first enemies you will face in the game, lead as a violet military to take over the Origin System. Originally Lead by Captain Vor the one responsible for your awakening wanted to use your power to aid him in taking over. You fight back against Captain Vor and eventually kill him, However Vor was holding The Janus Key a very powerful item, this granted him immortality with the cost of being stuck in the void.</p>
            
            
            <br>
            <h5>Corpus:</h5>
            <p>The Corpus founded by Parvos Granum, the son of a humble family of farmers who lived during the Orokin era. Enraged by the disparity of his masters and the ones who worked under them and believing that anyone, no matter their social status has the right to set off on their own quest for profit, This lead to Parvos building a the city of Corposium where anyone can apply with their wit and desire to make their own wealth to lead Corpus board of directors of the newly founded Corpus.</p>
            <p>you fight Alad V a high ranking Corpus member after being defeated by you believed he could control the Infestation and lost himself to it.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Infested:</h5>
            <p>The Infested are mutated deformed versions of Grineer and Corpus, taken over by techno organic parasites created by the Orokin The logest Infested are called Ancients infested for so long their original form is no longer recignisable it's believed they could age back to the old war itself.</p>

            <br>

            <h5>Orokin:</h5>
            <p>The Orokin are an ancient civilization that ruled the Orogin System in the distant pass during the Orokin era, Who build technological masterpieces that surpass even todays technology while much is not known about the orokin however they are scarce and almost entirely responsible for the current state of the Origin system.</p>
            <p>Ballas is the Orokin you fight with his deep desire of controling others and being a natrual liar, he harbors a deep hatred for the Tenno, blaming them for taking Margulis' love from him and her death.</p>
